# Survival System

## Focus
Implements core survival-world interactions, enabling players to gather resources, modify the environment, and collect materials needed for crafting and progression.  
This module defines destructible environmental objects and their resource-yielding behaviors, forming the foundation of the game's survival loop.

## Key Scripts

**Tree.cs** – Implements the full tree-chopping mechanic.  
Handles axe damage, applies physics-based falling behavior, and spawns resource drops such as logs and branches.  
Triggers sound and visual feedback on impact, enhancing the realism and responsiveness of environmental interactions.
